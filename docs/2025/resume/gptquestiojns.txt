QUESTIONS TO RECALL HIDDEN EXPERIENCES
For Senior Software Engineer (Hands-On)
Complex Code Challenges:

What’s the most complex piece of code or system you’ve written (beyond standard tasks)?

Have you implemented performance improvements (reduced runtime, improved efficiency) in critical systems?

Languages & Tools:

You mentioned building Python & shell libraries — did you integrate these into production workflows at Experian?

Have you worked with CICS, VSAM, REXX, or COBOL in production environments (beyond basic exposure)? If yes, where and how?

Mainframe Work:

Have you done deep debugging in z/OS or mainframe environments?

Have you written complex JCL scripts for batch processes (e.g., multiple step jobs, error handling, dataset management)?

For AI/ML Engineer (Data & Automation)
Model Development:

Beyond your ANN & ETL projects, have you trained, optimized, or deployed ML models for work-related problems?

Have you used Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch in production or experimental contexts?

Automation:

You mentioned automating reporting and research — did you integrate these automations with other systems (APIs, dashboards, batch jobs)?

Data Pipelines:

Have you designed ETL processes that handled large-scale or sensitive financial data?

For Tech Lead / Engineering Manager
Team Development & Mentorship:

You’ve coached others to move from admin to dev roles — can you detail how many people you mentored and their progression?

Have you conducted formal or informal code reviews and what was your approach to improving team code quality?

Cross-Team Coordination:

Beyond the Amazon STAR stories, any large multi-team projects where you were the go-to coordinator or decision-maker?

Process Improvements:

You redesigned the High Potential program — have you implemented technical processes (branching strategy, deployment workflows) that improved team performance significantly?

For the Mainframe Sr Programmer Analyst role (Citi)
COBOL/JCL specifics:

Have you written or maintained COBOL programs interacting with DB2/VSAM in a financial context?

Have you done data conversion or migration between formats like EDI, ACH, BAI2, XML, or sequential files?

CICS:

Any online transaction processing development (CICS or similar)?

Performance & Debugging:

Have you been involved in root cause analysis of mainframe application failures or performance tuning?

Recent Projects
Medic CRM:

Can you share more technical details? (e.g., database structure, Flask blueprint usage, CI/CD if any, authentication design, deployment challenges).

Did you build this solo or with collaborators?

Next:
If you answer these, I’ll:

Expand your experience section with these missing achievements.

Strengthen your technical profile (COBOL/JCL, CICS, VSAM, z/OS) for roles like Citi’s.

Add AI/ML depth (pipelines, models, experiments).

Highlight leadership contributions (mentorship, cross-team work).

Would you like me to prepare a template where you can just jot down short answers for each question (to make it quick)?
Or should we go one section at a time (e.g., start with Mainframe experiences first)?
