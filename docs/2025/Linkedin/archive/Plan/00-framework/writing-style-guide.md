# Writing Style Guide

Principles
- Lead with outcome and thesis in the first 2-3 lines.
- Prefer short sentences (12-18 words). Use active voice.
- Replace abstractions with concrete nouns, numbers, and examples.
- Cut filler words (very, really, actually, basically).
- Show one idea per paragraph.

Formatting
- Mobile-first: first lines must be skimmable standalone.
- Use H2/H3 to chunk sections. Bullets over long paragraphs.
- Use `code` style for terms, functions, or metrics.
- Link sources; quantify claims.

Clarity
- Define acronyms on first use.
- Prefer specific verbs (measure, ship, prune) over vague ones (do, handle).
- Replace weak claims with evidence or remove them.

Tone
- Direct, pragmatic, respectful. Confident, never hypey.

LinkedIn specifics
- 2-5 precise hashtags (#LLM #RAG #SoftwareEngineering).
- End with a CTA that invites specific replies.
- Break lines to create visual rhythm for scanning.
