Management,Ascend turnover models to Lisa Team - Team corrdination with Vivi,My Team needed deliver around 25 models to another team on an tight date using new methods and formats which were not clear at that time,"I first established points of contact for each topic, SME on both teams and project management in both team, in our eam I was the one managing the project. Then we establish a general strategy for the majority of the models and delivery dates.", Then I coordinated development and induction of the new methods to use in the delivery within the team which allow us to deliver everything on time and with a clear view of the process to follow and the gaps that were still there between both teams strategies.,"This showed me that I was able to coordinate a complex code delivery on a technical and project management level, indentifying the SMEs and pain points quickly so any obstacle were removed in time and requirements were clear."
Management,Convergent / Deployment of new model on many ways for many teams / cross-teams coordination,"Design, Development, Testing and Implementation of a model streamline process that involved 4 teams just on the technical details. 
Basically an external batch aplication would receive information that after processing will be used to generate inquiries used to call another aplication that finally will call the model and return results","I first helped the Data Science team to refine and rewrite their specs to cover a lot of edge and missed cases, such ass default, exception values and missing weight assigment previous to an weighted score calculation.
Secondly, I created a new model standard to include new external input data sources which included and internal API and client perovided data, along with the use of new brand attributes.
Thirdly, I assisted the team that will be calling the model in the design and testing of the interface that will call the model in their end.
I also helped on the design of the solution that will receive the external call from the client and pass the data into the intermediate application.
Finally, I identified sources of unexpected results along the process after the implementation and business rules design.","After some tweeks post-implementation the model was successfully put in production which allowed new capability regarding model execution across different platform, along with a huge contract maintained with a client.","I figured that I was able to see and show different points of view based on different levels of the development and design during this process. This allowed me to speak on ""different laguages"" across the board which finally gave me and teams involved a sense of direction and accountability."
Customer Care,Opportun Model Development - Tailoring Specs and define audit process with customer,Help the client to refine their specs and agree on a method of models validation between the involved parts.,"I worked hand by hand with the client's data scientist to refine and enhance the model specs document in order to get the standards in place for us to develop and imlpement such model.
Then a new method of test input, intermediate and output data delivery was developed and used in the model validation.","The client was very satisfied to able to enhance their current algorithm based on specs refinement and audit process.
The model was implemented without further problems, and new projects related to attributes addition to the model were requested by the client.","I'm very proud of this one, because my counter part on the client's side and I were able to connect and collaborate really well in order to deliver a great value at the end of the project."
Customer Care,Fixes on a model several times with tight deadlines to acomp´lish client expectation on delivery for implementation in their side / coordionation between areas / identificatin of collaborators and stones,"2 hot fixes were needed for a model implementation in order to get it right.
The first one was because of late testing 3 days before the implementation showed specs and audit discrepancies.
The second one was because of late testing 5 days before the implementation some platform incompabilities were noticed.","In both cases I tried to quickly identy collaborators and critical alternatives to solve the issue and meet implementation dates.
I did the hot fixes which involved reduce work from 5 days to 1 or 2 and coordinated with business and other platform team the rush implementation.",The client was satisfied with the implementation and the business person was able to save face with them since we keep our dates in implementation (which were previously delayed by other factors related to the other platform).,"In this kind of situation I try to quickly identify proactive and reactive parties involved, and try to establish if one of the critical alternatives can be delivered without asking non-standard action from the reactive parties. 
This have gave me Great results on client's related deadlines fixes/projects."
Details,Identify and rise awareness on PINnning errorswhich lead to solve a massive issue which could have been cathastrophic(7 of 14 team memebers were dedicated to solve the issue next morning) (c9),"A batch system for thousand of clients that runs daily, failed at EOD notifying as expected, and according to the leads and SME at that time there was not reason to worry about at that moment.","Looking closely at the notifications I noticed that the steps on which the system failed were not the usual ones, so I looked deeper and found that there was a masive fail in a critical process which would have a much bigger impact than expected. Fortunately I communicated the situation, other SME look at the issue and agreed with me and found out that there was an inminent production impact.","The fix started asap and 11 of 15 people of the team were assigned to help on fixing the issue, there was not major impact and couinter measures were put in place for future errors like that one.",
Innovation,Redesign and implementation of new High Potential employee program delivering 18 new participants,"After participating on a country level high potential employee program to aid employees to learn more about the company and the people working on it, I volunteered myself to participate as member of the comitee that runs the program. The program was good, but not great.","A co-worker and I redesiigned the entire program to include a points and topic system, so instead of just attending live session , you had the option of choose which activity to participate on. Some activites were proactive, meaning that there weren't any associated session to it, instead you had to look for how to meet the requirements.","The program successfully graduated 18 students under the new program that year, with great results about participation, and team leaders expectations. So the structure remain and is still being used to deliver that program yearly.",
Innovation,Creation of script of visualize and understand relations between members/filters/attributes on a model - I would have done better on this for real adoption of the tool ading debug values (C9.3),"Debugging and understanding of rtesults and intermediate results on models has been always a challenging task. There is no standard approach to locate model inconsistencuies or undestand the root cause of results, so a tool to understand better the inrternal relations between model pieces was needed.","I designed, developed and implemented a set of scripts that using plotly library generates a 3d plot diagram that shows the relation between different variable on the model. The scripts allowed to get allthe element or a subset of them to track and research on relations between variables.",The approach allowed the team to accelerate model researchs and specs refiniement. Using the graphical interface the developers were able to dig depeer and faster on model's elements relations.,
Innovation,Simplification of a ANN to a yaml file (C8),"There are a loot of ANN implementations there, but I wanted to design and develop my full implementation of the algorithm that allowed me to fully use and train a ANN.","So I look for some tutoraisl and ended up designing and creating a full set of scripts that allowed me to create and implement a ANN based on a TAML configuration file, on which the whole net was described.",This allowed me to better understand how the neural nets work and prepare myself to continue on next steps towqards gradient descent learning or explaniability.,
Innovation,Simplification of an ETL process to a yaml file (C8),"There are a lo of implementation of ETL proccesses, bhutI wanted one that was fully written by me so I could understand every bit of how it works in in the background.","so I created a set of script from scratch mainly using pandas and keras to implement an ETL and ML flow, generating statisics and csv reports along the process.","I used this set of script on some personal projects, which allowed me to iterate on the design and refactor the conventions and code. In the end the set still is a work in progress but is pretty handy to process almost any kind of numeric or string data.",
Innovation,Learned Python/shell which has saved me and my team onb several ocations when some quick researchs for critical projects are required / like MIPS or ARf to TIP 512 match,"As any other team there are some quick and weird challenges along the way. Many of them were previously solved using tools that were already on place, but since this approach required expertise with legacy tools and private scripts, it continusly generated technical debt and didnt allowed the team to learn new ways.","I put myself on the spot to solve many of the incoming challenges for the team using new tools. Some of the were solved using a set of libraries and scripts written under MVC design in SSH, and others were solved using python.",This allowed the team to gain the ability of tackle these unconventional challenges in the faster and more sustainable way(because the script were more explanatory and followed better conventions that the old tools),"I was able to scalate my skills o scripting on hackerrank or kaggle into actuakl job challenges, so it was a win win for everyone."
Ownership,Participation on flexwork program as ambassador (C7.3),"A new company policy was being implemented in our site, but it required participation of local individuals to promote, participate and educate about the program. I put myslke fon the spot in order ot egt things done properly.","I usually are involved on this initiatives, because I think that they need a higher level of proactiveness to get things right. I was able to educate my whole team on the initiative, and got additional volunteers to participate. After implementation I was one of the firsdt persons on adopt this way of work, reducing the work week from 5 to 4 days without complaints.",This allowed other individuals to access this program and be prepared about the steps to follow and reponsabilities involved in this new way of work.,
Ownership,Model Arqueology - Automation of many processes to speed up research/fix/recompile/terst and deployment (C10),Previous approached to get and imlement old models in new platform created a lot bug and issues. A new procedure was required to get models properly i migrated from old to new platforms.,"I was assigned as the team's point of contacxt on this matter, so I research, designed and put in place a process that ensured consistency for old model migration into new platforms, including an index on that gave visibility of the state of thew migration to stakeholders, product owner and scrum masters on different teams,",Ithe new platform were able to stabilize the models in their end which in turn allowed better development cycle and product development. The approach was taken about 2 years agio and is stilll on place.,
Ownership,Took over blood donation campaign organization when previous organizer left the country,The organizer of the blood campaign (my manager at that time) was in   their relocation process which ionvolved pass on the process of organization  and executaion of the blood donation campaign in the compan'ys bulding to someone else.,I step up and made myself responsible of the process.,The campaign continued their normal scheduel in the company allowing keeping this important and great initiative to help others.,
Ownership,"Coordinate my classsmates to meet the complete subject expectations while we were off classes due to stundet-strike in the whole university. We had like 3 weeks of classes and came back at the end of the semester, but we were able to finish the subject successfully in ",There was a difficutl year for the students of our generation at the university. But specially at the end where a lot of projects were overdue.,"I coordination the proactive action of get requirements from the teachers and meet the expectations of the pending projects, even without having the corresponding classes that were supossed to interoduce us to the tools/topics to be used in the projects dcevelopment.",We were able to finish our subject in time without any delay or extra or additional time/classes. Everyone passed the tests and approved the suibjects.,
Team Care,Implementation of good practices on Bitbucket use (C7.3) (c9),"When I entered the models team, there was a very problematic branching strategy and little to no use of biutbucket for model's code verisoning.","I designed and put in pla ed better repository and practices in place, and was made bitbucket's team owner and responsible for repositories creation/support/access.","The team was able to move all their code versioning to bitbucket, along with that others team were able to access  our code in different ways and integrate our commits in their pipelines.",
Team Care,"Creation of training material about propietary tools of the company which didnt have a good training induction, it was used to the introduction of about 8 new team memebers with good results.",I did not have any formal onboarding training or process and some tools were particularly tricky to understand.,So I created some material uincluding diagram to better explain and give training to newcomers to the group.,The diagrams are part of the formal training for everyone new in the group now and I was able to start onboarding new team members.,
