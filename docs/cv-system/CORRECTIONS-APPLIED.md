## Key Changes Summary

### Professional Summaries Now Say:

**Generic:**
> Senior Software Engineer with **11 years of experience** delivering complex, high-impact technical solutions...

**Python-Focused:**
> Senior Python Engineer with **5 years professional experience** building production backend systems...

**Skills Section Now Shows:**
```

## Why This Matters

**Honesty in Applications:**
- More accurate representation of professional Python usage
- Distinguishes between hobby/personal vs professional environment usage
- Maintains credibility during interviews when asked to elaborate

**Strategic Positioning:**
- 5 years professional Python is still strong (mid-to-senior level)
- 11 years total experience shows solid career progression
- Rare mainframe + modern skills still differentiate you

**ATS Optimization:**
- Accurate years prevent over-promising
- Still meets most "3-5+ years Python" requirements
- Strong in other areas (C, SQL, Shell, mainframe)

## Interview Talking Points

If asked about Python experience:

**Good Response:**
> "I have 5 years of professional Python experience at Experian, where I built production systems, ETL pipelines, automation frameworks, and ML projects. I've also used Python extensively in personal projects for longer, which gave me a strong foundation when I brought it into my professional work. My Python experience includes Flask web apps, Pandas/NumPy data processing, automation scripting, and machine learning pipelines."

**What to Emphasize:**
- 5 years is solid professional experience
- Production systems, not just scripts
- Diverse Python usage (web, data, ML, automation)
- 11 years total backend experience (not just Python)

For your CV system:
- Update in January each year
- Add +1 to all professional years
- Keep distinctions clear (professional vs personal)
