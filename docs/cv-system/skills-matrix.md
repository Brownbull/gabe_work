## How to Use This Matrix

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Basics
- **What:** Software that scans CVs for keywords before human review
- **Why:** 75%+ of applications filtered by ATS before reaching recruiters
- **How to Win:** Include exact keyword matches from job descriptions

### Usage Strategy
1. **Copy job description** into analyzer (Jobscan, Resume Worded)
2. **Identify top keywords** from job posting
3. **Check this matrix** for your proficiency level
4. **Add keywords naturally** to CV sections
5. **Don't keyword stuff** - keep it readable

## 12. ATS Formatting Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Use standard section headers: "Professional Experience", "Skills", "Education"
- Include keywords in context (sentences, not just lists)
- Repeat important keywords 2-3 times naturally across CV
- Use both acronyms and full terms: "ML" and "Machine Learning"
- Use job title variations: "Software Engineer", "Software Developer"
- Include years of experience: "Python (13+ years)"
- Use standard file format: PDF or DOCX (PDF preferred)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Hide keywords in white text (ATS detects this)
- Use tables for main content (some ATS can't parse)
- Use images or graphics for text
- Use headers/footers for important content
- Use unusual fonts or formatting
- Keyword stuff unnaturally (example: "Python Python Python")
- Use uncommon section names: "My Journey" instead of "Experience"

---

## 13. Keyword Density Tool Usage

### Recommended Tools:
- **Jobscan** (jobscan.co) - Compare CV to job description
- **Resume Worded** (resumeworded.com) - ATS optimization

### How to Use:
1. **Copy target job description**
2. **Upload your tailored CV**
3. **Review keyword match percentage**
4. **Identify missing critical keywords**
5. **Add keywords naturally to CV**
6. **Recheck until 75%+ match**

### Warning:
- Don't blindly add all suggested keywords
- Only include keywords you can honestly discuss
- Prioritize keywords you're strongest in
