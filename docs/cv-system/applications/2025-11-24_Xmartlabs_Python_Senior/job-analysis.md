## Positioning Strategy

### Lead With:
- **5 years professional Python** (property attributes, validation frameworks)
- **Flask production: model containerization + feature store**
- **React 18 + TypeScript PWA in production** (Boletapp - 79.51% test coverage)
- **Strong testing culture** (Unit/Integration/E2E with Playwright, CI/CD via GitHub Actions)
- **AI integration experience** (Google Gemini, Claude AI in production apps)
- **11 years backend experience** (depth)
- **Credit risk / data analytics** (complex systems)
- **Performance optimization** (94% improvements)
- **Mentorship and code quality** (culture fit)

### Emphasize:
- Open-source mindset (public GitHub repos with live production apps)
- Code quality and comprehensive testing (79.51% coverage)
- Full-stack capability (React + TypeScript + Firebase + Python)
- Autonomous work style (remote-ready, shipped 2 live apps independently)
- Learning agility (built ANN from scratch, adopted modern frontend stack)
- Cross-team collaboration
- AI/ML integration (practical experience with Gemini, Claude)

### Address Proactively:
- **Flask/FastAPI experience:** "1 year production Flask at Experian (property attributes entry point); actively learning FastAPI with Railway deployments; strong fundamentals transfer across frameworks"
- **Docker:** "Familiar with containerization; eager to deepen Kubernetes/Docker expertise in production environment"
- **Frontend:** ~~"Backend-focused with foundational frontend knowledge"~~ → **"Full-stack capable: React 18 + TypeScript PWA in production (Boletapp); backend remains primary strength but can contribute across the stack"**
- **Testing/CI-CD:** ~~"Experience but can strengthen"~~ → **"Proven track record: 79.51% test coverage with comprehensive unit/integration/E2E testing; GitHub Actions CI/CD in production"**
- **Personal Projects Clarity:** Always mark personal projects as such to maintain honesty
