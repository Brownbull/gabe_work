## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Do I really need to tailor every CV?**
A: YES! Tailored CVs have 3-5x higher response rates. 30-60 min investment is worth it.

**Q: What if I don't have a required skill?**
A: Options:
1. Don't apply (if it's truly critical and you have zero related experience)
2. Address proactively: "Strong Python and C experience; currently learning Kubernetes"
3. Emphasize related skills: No Terraform? Emphasize infrastructure-as-code mindset

**Q: What about gaps in employment (post-2025)?**
A:
